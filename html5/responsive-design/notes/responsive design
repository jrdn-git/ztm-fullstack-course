# what it will cover:
- how to approach a layout
- CSS units (absolute, relative, and percentages)
- flexbox basics (layout tool)
- media query basics (adapting to different screen sizes)

# css units
- absolute units; pixels (px); pt, cm, mm, in, etc.
- percentages (mainly used for widths)
    - relative to parent (except on height)
- relative units
    - units relative to font-size:
        - em and rem
    - units relative to the viewport:
        - vw, vh, vmin, vmax

# percentages
- using percentages will force containers to 
respond with the screen size

# working with image widths
- percentages work best with images in order
to make them act reponsively
- if in container, give 100% width/height to make
the image act responsively

# max-width / min-width
- max-width can be used to stop containers/images/etc. from 
growing, works perfectly for keeping text on multiple lines, etc.
- min-width gives it a width to stop shrinking @...

# the 'em' unit
- 'em' and 'rem' are considered relative b/c they are relative
to the font-size of their parents
- font-size is an inherited property, so if not declared, it is 
getting it from the body (or the default, which is 16px)
- 1.5em is = to 150% the font-size of the parent
